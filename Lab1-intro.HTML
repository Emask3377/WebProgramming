    <h1>Welcome to My First Ever Web Page!</h1>
    <p>I am starting to learn HTML. Starting from the basics and working my way up. 
        I have learned how to make headers and paragraphs. I have also learned how to create links and images.
    Exciting, right?!</p>
    <p>This is a <strong>basic</strong> HTML page created as an example.</p>
